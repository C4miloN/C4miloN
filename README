The first part is called The Pledge. 
The magician shows you something ordinary...
The second act is called The Turn. 
The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary...
But you wouldnt clap yet. Because making something disappear isnt enough. 
You have to bring it back.

Thats why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call The Prestige.
